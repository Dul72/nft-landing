                    <p>
                        When you buy our token‚Ä¶ this becomes your permanent ticket to ALL future treasure hunts.
                      <br>
                        This Treasure Hunt token is your access pass to every treasure hunt that we host. 
                        Mr. ETH has been on the run, leaving clues, for quite some time, with the evil 
                        Banker always just a step right behind.
                        <br>
                        So even if you don‚Äôt win this time‚Ä¶ you can play again all
                         future treasure hunts, FOR FREE.
                         <br>
                        All future games will be determined by the 
                        community, but there will ALWAYS be an active treasure hunt 
                        game going with a large ETH prize.  
                        <br>
                         Our team is here to listen to the community‚Ä¶ we feel there will be
                          a big potential for many style games in the future utilizing the NFT
                           Treasure Hunt tokens, should the community decide to expand.

                    <p>
                        Subsequent games that we will be launching at a higher buy in price. 
                        In other words, holding the Treasure Hunt token gets you access to the next 
                        game for FREE‚Ä¶ while future ‚Äúhunters‚Äù will have to pay more, to get access to 
                        Treasure Hunts. But you will be grandfathered, and can play for free.

                        ALL royalties from the secondary 
                        sales of the game passes will be kept into a 
                        separate wallet to fund a community DAO. <br>

                        These funds can then be used to increase the
                         value of future treasure hunts.<br>

                       The community will have a direct say over what those funds are used for, be it the 
                       development of another game, larger prizes for winners, marketing of the project, etc. <br>

                        We believe that after several treasure hunts have been hosted, 
                        there‚Äôs a possibility of publishing and selling books made of the previous games 
                        for all to enjoy (without an ETH prize, that is) üòâ.
                        100% of the profits of these digital books will either: <br>
                        <span>- be distributed across holders </span><br>
                        <span>- directly put into the DAO fund ; or</span><br>
                        <span>- be added to the prize pool for upcoming treasure hunts.</span>
                        <br>
                        We truly are community driven, in the spirit of decentralization and in the style of 
                        Mr. ETH, so the community will have the ultimate say.

                        It's full of funny scenes and symbolism‚Ä¶ this allows us to start T-shirt and 
                        merch utilizing the funny micro-events that you‚Äôll see inside the 12 gigantic scenes.  
                        More on that can be discussed in the discord.<br>

                        TL;DR: sold merch is going to become an essential pillar of funding the community wallet.
